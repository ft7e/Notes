# Sequelize-Normalization

#### There are three standard types of associations:

- One to One

- One to Many

- Many to Many

### There are 4 types of associations that should be combined to create associations

- The HasOne association
- The BelongsTo association
- The HasMany association
- The BelongsToMany association

## Creating the standard relationships

In summary:

- To create a One-To-One relationship, the hasOne and belongsTo associations are used together;
- To create a One-To-Many relationship, the hasMany and belongsTo associations are used together;
- To create a Many-To-Many relationship, two belongsToMany calls are used together.
