# Summary

**_Practice the Terminal_**

Learnt that it's Case sensitive and extintionless and that everything is a file moreover having a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/h4mz411y/reading-notes/blob/main/Prep%20Practice%20in%20the%20Terminal/CHEATSHEET.md) that helped me.

The terminal can offer same or more features that windows and you can do stuff pretty fast but you need some time to get used to it.
