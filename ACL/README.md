# ACL

#### An access control list (ACL) is a list of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a particular object or system resource. Access control lists are also installed in routers or switches, where they act as filters, managing which traffic can access the network.

# Benefits of RBAC?

#### With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

#### RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

# RBAC implementation :

- Inventory your systems
- Analyze your workforce and create roles
- Assign people to roles
- Never make one-off changes
- Audit
