# Redux Toolkit

We can't solve every use case, but in the spirit of create-react-app, we can try to provide some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.

Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching and caching capability that we've dubbed "RTK Query". It's included in the package as a separate set of entry points. It's optional, but can eliminate the need to hand-write data fetching logic yourself.

These tools should be beneficial to all Redux users. Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to simplify an existing application, Redux Toolkit can help you make your Redux code better.

# How to use Redux Toolkit

The Redux core library is deliberately unopinionated. It lets you decide how you want to handle everything, like store setup, what your state contains, and how you want to build your reducers.

This is good in some cases, because it gives you flexibility, but that flexibility isn't always needed. Sometimes we just want the simplest possible way to get started, with some good default behavior out of the box. Or, maybe you're writing a larger application and finding yourself writing some similar code, and you'd like to cut down on how much of that code you have to write by hand.

As described in the Quick Start page, the goal of Redux Toolkit is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of the Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler (or in some cases, eliminate some of the hand-written code entirely).

Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux (like Reselect and Redux-Thunk). This lets you decide how to use these in your own application, whether it be a brand new project or updating a large existing app.

Let's look at some of the ways that Redux Toolkit can help make your Redux-related code better.
