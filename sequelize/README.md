# Difference Between SQL & NOSQL

- SQL is a powerful language for defining and manipulating data in SQL databases. Queries in a NoSQL database are focused on document collecting. It's also referred to as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax for utilizing UnQL differs depending on the database, ex : My SQL, Postgres

- NoSQL databases are document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based databases. This indicates that SQL databases represent data in the form of tables with n rows of data, but NoSQL databases are collections of key-value pairs, documents, graph databases, or wide-column stores that do not have standard schema definitions, ex : MongoDB
