# AWS API Gateway

## What is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests.

## Benefits of Amazon API Gateway

Map HTTP requests to specific functions in a Serverless application via an API Gateway event.

Connecting HTTP endpoints to individual functions is straightforward with API Gateway, obviating the need for a dedicated API server

Map WebSocket events to Serverless functions. If you are building a WebSocket API, API Gateway also lets you map its events to a Serverless function. This works great for real-time functionality like in-app updates and notifications.

Use multiple microservices to serve the same top-level API. API Gateway makes it easy to have different Serverless functions serving different parts of your API. This means you can better encapsulate your functionality into each function and clearly separate the business logic of different parts of your API. Another benefit here is that you can transparently replace the function called by a given API request—the users won’t notice any change on the API layer.

Save time with integrations: authentication, developer portal, CloudTrail, CloudWatch. API Gateway allows you to implement a fully managed authentication and authorization layer by using Amazon Cognito and Lambda custom authorizers without running your own auth systems. By using API Gateway you also get access to the developer portals that are generated automatically from your API schemas. In addition, CloudTrail, CloudWatch and X-RAY all integrate with API Gateway, simplifying the profiling and debugging of API requests
